# Financial Data Analysis
In this project, you are going to use the following data sheets that are provided to extract averages, totals, and comparisons to get better insight of the data. Download the `Data.zip` file and extract the files.

Scenario:
> You are a data analyst at a Hedge Fund and your manager just handed you 4 excel sheets from different dates. The data sets contain stock symbols from across the major stock indexes. Each symbol contains some data points. You are asked to analyze, manipulate, and send them a new excel sheet containing the analyzed data.

## How to begin
To start, create a folder for this project, extract the files into the folder, and open up a new window in Atom to begin coding.

In order to test your program, in the search bar of your **File Explorer**, type in `cmd` or `terminal` to open a command prompt or terminal directed to the folder. This will allow you to call the following command relative to your folder so you do not have to type in the whole path to your Python folder: `py [name of file].py` and your data should print.

## Task
The program you will create must do the following:
1. Open each file **regardless of name** in the folder `Data`
   1. This means that you are to figure out a way to open up all the files, without specifying the file names individually (*I've said too much*)
1. Pull all the data out
1. Put them into a dictionary
1. Clean up the data
1. Get the total number of symbols
1. Alphabetically organize the data using the fastest sorting method
1. Save the data into a `.csv` file

After you completed the program, figure out how to get the duration of the program: *How long does it take for your program to run?* 

**Currently, there is no optimal time to get.**

## Requirements
In the program, you must achieve the following requirements:
1. Use a **generator expression**
1. Catch errors using **try & except**
1. Comment your code

## Watch Out For
Things to watch out for:
1. Type errors
1. Insufficient data

To test your program, I recommend `print()` whenever you want to see how your data came out. From there, you can analyze what is going on in your code. 

**Good for testing, not production!**
