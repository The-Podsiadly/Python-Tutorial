# Python Tutorial
Learn Python in an interactive way. No more simple little projects and "type this to get that". Guided tutorial that forces the pupil to learn through self-discovery. I won't be there to hold their hand when they're working in the professional setting.
## Requirements
In order to take full advantage of this tutorial, there are 2 things you are required to have:
1. [Download the latest Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   a. [Windows](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python-3.8.2.exe)
   b. [Windows 64-bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python-3.8.2-amd64.exe)
   c. [Mac OS X 64-bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python-3.8.2-macosx10.9.pkg)
2. [Download the latest version of Atom](https://atom.io/)
These 2 tools are what will get you through this tutorial series.

## Content
This tutorial will compromise of 10 projects. All getting harder and building off of one another. We will focus on learning to learn on your own and answering questions you have by looking it up; *trial and error*. As a programmer, you will at any level be looking stuff up, but the more you program, the easier fixing and optimizing will get.
The skills I hope you will get out of this tutorial:
- Being able to figure out the errors and how to fix them on your own.
- Looking up answers to certain problems without relying on a "teacher"
- Optimizing code to minimize time and redudancies
- Having an idea of how to approach real-world problems and build your own programs

*What are the topics we are going to go over?*
You will create programs ranging from Excel sheet data analysis to basic machine learning algorithm. Here is a list of the 10 projects you will be working on:
1. Financial data analysis
2. Stock market data webscraping & analysis
3. HTML email sender
4. Asynchronous data manipulation
5. Recreating a simulation
6. Communction program
7. Web application
8. Machine learning
9. Blockchain
10. AI IoT Surveillance System

Don't be scared. You'll be able to show off your skills to recruiters after this. During some project, I will have a short guide on how to setup a Github account through Atom so you can **Push** and **Commit** your projects. We will be using Github as our version control. It's the easiest to access public files and check the code out.
